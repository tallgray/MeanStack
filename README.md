## Overview

In the fast-paced realm of software development, where innovation is constant and timelines are tight, this project provides a solution to accelerate development cycles. It demonstrates the synergy of Docker Compose, MongoDB, Express.js, Nginx, and a web interface to create a highly efficient and modular application architecture.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main components:

1. **mongo-db:** Manages the MongoDB database.
2. **app-server:** Implements the business logic using Node.js and Express.js.
3. **web-server:** Serves as the web interface with Angular.

Each component has its own directory with a Dockerfile and associated source code.
